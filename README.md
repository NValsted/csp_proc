# csp_proc
Lightweight, programmable procedures with a libcsp- and libparam-native runtime. This library has a relatively small footprint suitable for microcontrollers, requiring no external libraries other than libcsp and libparam themselves.

This provides remote control over coordination between nodes in a CSP network, essentially exposing the network as single programmable unit.
